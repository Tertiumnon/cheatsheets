# Object-oriented programming (OOP)

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

5 rules of OOP are SOLID.

## Abstraction

A programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

## Encapsulation

The bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

## Polymorphism

The ability (in programming) to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types).

## Inheritance

When a class derives from another class.
