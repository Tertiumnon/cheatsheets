# Event Methods

## preventDefault()

Method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur.

## stopPropagation()

Method prevents propagation of the same event from being called.

Propagation means bubbling up to parent elements or capturing down to child elements.
