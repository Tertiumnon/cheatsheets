- Single responsibility
- Open-closed
- Liskov substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency inversion

## Single responsibility

A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.

## Open-closed

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution

An object (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) without breaking the program.

## Interface segregation

No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## Dependency inversion

The conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module implementation details.
