# SOLID

- Single responsibility
- Open-closed
- Liskov substitution
- Interface segregation
- Dependency inversion

## Single responsibility

A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.

## Open-closed

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov substitution

An object (such as a class) may be replaced by a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) without breaking the program.

## Interface segregation
