# Hydration

Hydration in Angular refers to the process where the client-side, JavaScript code takes over the server-rendered HTML markup, making the page interactive. When using Angular Universal for SSR, the server initially renders the HTML and sends it to the client. Hydration is the step where Angular bootstraps on the client side, enabling dynamic behavior and interactivity.
