# Virtual DOM

A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the Document Object Model (DOM) used in declarative web frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Elm.

When a user interacts with a web page, React updates the Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version, and only updates the Real DOM with the necessary changes. This process is known as Reconciliation.
