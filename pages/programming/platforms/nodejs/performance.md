# Performance

- Serving Node.js static assets with Nginx
- Using caching strategies such as Redis to reduce application lookups
- Implementing database query optimization to ensure database queries are as efficient as possible, not adding too much server latency
- Tracking down memory leaks to ensure running services donâ€™t hold on to memory unnecessarily. A garbage collector allows you to analyze memory leaks
- Real-time monitoring and logging to analyze and get real-time metrics on your Node.js application's performance
- Optimize your Node.js API for data processing by implementing pagination. Build your Node.js application with the optimal server strategy, such as integrating Node.js with gRPC to resolve requests from a gateway to a server. Reduce server responses and network traffic with GraphQL
