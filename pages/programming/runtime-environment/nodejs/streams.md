# Streams

## Stream types

- *Readable* – Used for reading operations
- *Writable* − Used for write operations
- *Duplex* − Can be used for both reading and write operations
- *Transform* − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

## Piping

*Piping* is a mechanism used to connect the output of one stream to another stream. It is normally used to retrieve data from one stream and pass output to another stream.
