## Q&A

### Types, Primitives

### LexicalEnvironment

#### Differences between "const" and "function"

- `const` prevents reassignment of the name while function does not.
- Using an "arrow" function doesn't have it's own `lexical context`, so it won't have a scoped this and can't be used as a constructor while function can be.
- A "const arrow" function needs to be declared before calling it, otherwise it's undefined.
- A function can be declared after calling it.
